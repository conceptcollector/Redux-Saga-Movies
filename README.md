## Prerequisites

This app was built using React, React-Redux, and Redux-Saga. These will need to be installed before the application can be run.

### Database Setup

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`
2. Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database

### Install Dependencies

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run server`
3. `npm run client`

## Usage

Users will be met with a gallery of movie posters on the home page. The header reads "Hooray for Hollywood" surrounded by emojis, meaning to set the tone for the experience of the app.
Users can click on a movie poster and they will be brought to the movie's details. The poster, title, genres, and description will be displayed. A button at the bottom of the screen labeled "Let's All Go to the Lobby" will take the users back to the home page.
